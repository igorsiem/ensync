# enSync README #

## Overview ##

*enSync* is (or will be) a generic, open C++ library for performing data
syncronisation operations. Right now, that's the only statement we have about
what it is and what it does.

## What is this repository for? ##

This repo is for the source code of *enSync* and its documentation. For those
who know nothing about it, the *Product Vision Statement*
(`docs/high-level/product-vision-statement.md`).

## How do I get set up? ##

TBD - Instructions for setting up and using *enSync* will go here.

## Contribution guidelines ##

This is a free project, and contributions of any kind are welcome. This
section will include information on:

* Writing tests
* Code review
* Other guidelines

## Who do I talk to? ##

This project is currently owned and run by Igor Siemienowicz, who can be
